# sandwrm

This repo contains the code (in development) for the method **SANDWRM** - a statistical tool 
for estimating the parameters of the Wright-Mal√©cot model of isolation 
by distance. 

**SANDWRM** stands for: 
**S**patial **A**nalysis of **N**eighborhood and **D**iversity with the **WR**ight **M**alecot model.

The preprint describing this method can be found [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.03.10.532094v1.full).
